# Predicting Survival on the Titanic Using a FeedFoward Binary Clasification Neural Network
## Objective:
This project aims to create a classification neural network that predicts whether a person will survive or perish based on the Titanic dataset. 
Part 1: data manipulation using some common datascience libraries
Part 2: implementing a neural network for binary classification using deep learning frameworks TensorFlow and keras.

## Original dataset:
Dataset includes the following columns:
 PassengerId - Unique identifier for each passenger
 Survived - Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
 Pclass-Ticketclass(1=1st,2=2nd,3=3rd)
 Name - Name of the passenger
 Sex - Gender of the passenger
 Age - Age of the passenger
 SibSp - Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
 Parch - Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
 Ticket - Ticket number
 Fare - Passenger fare
 Cabin - Cabin number
 Embarked - Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Requirments 
```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras seaborn```

## Running the files
```python3 code2.py```
```python3 nn.py```
